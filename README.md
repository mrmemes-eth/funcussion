# Funcussion

More functional than your standard concussion!

## What is it?

Funcussion provides convenience methods on standard Objective-C objects that
help you write Objective-C in a functional style. Operations performed on a
collection always return a new collection. This is in stark opposition to the
mutable approach encouraged by a lot of Objective-C builtin analogs to the
methods provided here.

## Examples
